# Agent Operating Instructions

All agents working in this repository must log their changes and ideas in this file. This serves as a shared memory for future agents.

## Change Log
- After completing work and committing changes, append a bullet in this section that includes:
  - The commit hash.
  - A brief summary of what was changed.
  - Any reasoning or context that may help future agents.
- Keep entries in chronological order and do not remove previous items.

## Ideas / Planning
- Use this section to jot down ideas, future improvements, or notes that may help subsequent agents.
- Keep items brief, with dates if possible.

## Testing
- If the project includes tests or build steps, run them after changes. Note results in the change log.
- If no tests exist, mention that none were run.
